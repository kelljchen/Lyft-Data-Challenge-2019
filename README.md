# Lyft-Data-Challenge-2019
In fall of 2019, I worked with a classmate, Michelle Lee in a team called "Steel-Cut Oats" to participate in the 2019 Lyft Data Challenge to gain experience working with data cleaning and analysis. This was my first time working on a data hackathon project and applying my skills in R to a real-world data set. This repo contains the code used to analyze the data and generate the visuals for the report.

For the challenge, we were given a dataset containing information for Lyft driver data in San Francisco over a limited time frame. Variables included timestamps for various drive actions, driver IDs, drive IDs, destinations of the drives, etc. Our task was to calculate an average driver Lifetime Value and variables that could potentially predict that value. We ran into several challenges, namely cleaning and dealing with missing data between the datasets and generating strong models to actual predict driver Lifetime Value.

We worked with R, specifically the packages dplyr and tidyverse to give Lyft recommendations for actionable changes they should make to maximize revenue and lifetime of Lyft drivers.

This repo contains the following files:
* "Steel-Cut Oats_Writeup_KC_ML.pdf" - Our final report containing all the visuals and recommendations made to Lyft
* "Final Lyft Data Challenge Code.R" - All code used to generate descriptive statistics, analysis, and visuals.
