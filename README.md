# Lyft-Data-Challenge-2019
Participated in the Lyft Data Challenge 2019 to gain experience working with data cleaning and analysis. 

We worked with R, specifically the packages dplyr and tidyverse to give Lyft recommendations for actionable changes they should make to maximize revenue and lifetime of Lyft drivers.
